# COSC416_Studio2
Studio 2 for COSC 416 in Unity

Unfortuntly I was getting a bug where the launch indicator would spawn in a random location near the player rather than precisely where it should and I was unable to identify the root cause. I believe I followed the tutorial (updated version) to a tee but there must be a little something somewhere that is causing this. You will notice this in particular, you will also notice that after the second reset the indicator disappears, its not that it disappeared but rather the indicator respawnded under the floor where it can't be seen.
